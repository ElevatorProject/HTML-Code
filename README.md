# HTML-Code

This is where all the html and css code will lie for the elevator project.

## Getting Started

This is the repo for the front end of the elevator project website.OB

## Style Guide

### All Languages

- 4 Spaces should be used instead of tab

### HTML

- For HTML tabbing should be used to make code more readable

```
<body>
	<p>
	- A Paragraph
	- more text
	</p>
</body>
```
- For anything that requires more then one line the starting and closing of a section should be on their own line 
- Single line is ok to have everything on one line

```
<p>
- this is line 1
- this is line 2
</p>

<p> -all on one line </p>
```

### css

- For Functions that requrire more then one line bracket should be on the decleration
- The closing bracket should be on the same tabbing as the starting line for the function

```
u1 {
	some stuff;
	more stuff;
}
```

- It is ok to use single line declorations
```
u1{ some stuff;}
```
